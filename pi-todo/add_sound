1. Check USB Audio Device:
Ensure your Raspberry Pi detects the JBL speakers. Open a terminal on your Raspberry Pi and 
aplay -l

This command lists all audio devices. Look for your JBL speakers in the output.

2. Set USB Audio as Default Device:
If your speakers are detected, you need to set them as the default audio device. Edit the ALSA configuration file:

sudo nano /etc/asound.conf


3. Add the following content to set the USB audio device as the default:
pcm.!default {
  type hw
  card 1
}

ctl.!default {
  type hw
  card 1
}

4. Test Sound Output:
Use the speaker-test command to check the sound output:
speaker-test -c2 -twav

This command plays a test sound through the speakers. You should hear white noise or a test sound indicating successful setup.

5. Play Audio Files:
To play an audio file, you can use a media player like omxplayer or mplayer. For example:

omxplayer /path/to/your/audiofile.mp3

6. Adjust Volume:
You can adjust the volume using the alsamixer tool. Run:

alsamixer

7. Install Required Packages:
If you do not have omxplayer or mplayer installed, you can install them using:

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install omxplayer mplayer
